# Definitions
* Experiment
* Sample Space
* Events
* P(E)

## Experiment
* A process of observation that leads to a *single outcome* that cannot be predicted with *certaint*
## Event
* Event denoted by E is any subset of S
* E = Spades (the card is a spade)
* E = Heads (the card is a head)
* E = Component is functioning in a circuit
## P(E)
* Probability of the event E
* Probability a card is spades
* Probability coin is heads...
### Example 1
* Experiment      = Toss a coin
* Sample Space: S = {Heads, Tails}
* Event: E        = {Heads}
### Example 2
* Experiment      = Compile a computer program
* Sample Space: S = {Compiles, Does not Compiles}
* Event: E        = {Compiles}
### Example 3
* Experiment      = Run a program to measure its CPU time
* Sample Space: S = R+ = {t $\in$ R | t > 0}
* Event: E        = {t > 5}
## Types Of Sample Spaces
* Finite
  * finite number of outcomes (like examples 1,2)
* Infinite discrete
  * countably infinite eg count of all positive integers
* Continuous
  * finite or infinite intervals of real numbers
  * e.g a range of numbers such as heights between 1.5m and 1.55m
## Probabilities
### Classical approach
* P(E) = $(number of favourable outcomes)/(number of possible outcomes)$
* Assumes all outcomes of the experiment are *equally likely*
### Relative Frequency Approach
* P(E) = $(number of times E occurs)/(number of times experiment is repeated)$
