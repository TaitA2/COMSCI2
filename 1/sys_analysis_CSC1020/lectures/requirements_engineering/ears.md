## Syntax
* <optional preconditions><optional trigger> the <system name> shall <system response>
* Symple structure adds rigor & clarity
## Ubiquitous
* <system name> shall <system response>
## Event Driven
* *WHEN* <specific trigger occurs> the <system name> shall <system response>
## State Driven
* *WHILE* <in a specific state>, the <system name> shall <system response>
## Featured
* *WHERE* <feature is included> the <system name> shall <system response>
  * similar to ubiquitous but for specific system features

## Unwanted Behaviour
* A variation of event driven
* *IF* <optionanl precondition><triggers>, then the <system name> shall <system response>

## "Complex" Requirements Syntax
* When
* While
* Where
* If-Then
## Strengths
* Consistent
* Easy to learn / apply
* No tools needed
* Common
## Weaknesses
* Limited inter-requirement coupling
* Unsuitable for very complex requirements
  * Consider truth tables etc
