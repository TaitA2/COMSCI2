# Software process models
* The waterfall model
	* seperate and distinct phases of specification and development
	* plan driven
* Incremental development
* Re-use oriented development

## Waterfall model
* Requirements definition
* system and software design
* implementation and unit testing
* integration and system testing
* operation and maintenance
	* partitioning of the project into distinct stages makes it difficult to respond to changing requirements
	* used when requirements are well understood and there are limited changes
	* mostly used for large systems where a system is developed at several sites

## Incremental development
* shorter cycle time
* system delivered in pieces
	* enables customers to have some functionality while the rest is being developed
