### Paste dump
#### System Vision
#### Goal Model
* `Business Goals:
VLC Media Player’s business goals focus on maximizing market reach (BG1), remaining
free and open source (BG2), and ensuring long-term maintenance and performance (BG3).
The Parent Organisation and Project Owners aim to broaden VLC’s user base by maintaining
relevance in the competitive media software space. The Community and Donors play an
important role in keeping VLC free and open source, encouraging global collaboration,
transparency, and accessibility. Maintainers and Quality Assurance teams ensure the software
remains optimized, up to date, and compatible with new technologies`

* Conflicts
1. A conflict between the business goals regarding the software remaining free &
open source (BG2) and being able to provide long-term maintenance &
performance (BG3). For the software to run at high performance and be
maintained requires resources and funding that contradict the software being
free.
  * *Business goals*
2. User A conflict regarding the user being able to swiftly navigate the software (UG5)
and the user having a variety of tools at their disposal to edit media files
(UG6). More features and tools added to the software means more elements
added to the software’s interface making it possibly harder to navigate.
  * *User retention and User experience*

3. A conflict with the system providing security (SG3) and the system supporting
local and remote media (SG4). Remote media increases the chances for the
system to be exposed to malicious or corrupted media files and thus create
several unexpected security issues.`
  * *User trust and positive brand image*
