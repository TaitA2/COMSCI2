* Planning hardware and software system upgrades and changes in configuration
* Training system operators and application programmers
* Automating operations
* Capacity planning
* Running installation jobs and scripts
* Performing installation-specific customization tasks
* Integration-testing the new products with existing applications and user procedures
* System-wide performance tuning to meet required levels of service
## Overview
* The system programmer must be skilled at debugging problems with system software.
* These problems are often captured in a copy of the computer's memory contents called a dump , which the system produces in response to a failing software product, user job, or transaction.
* Armed with a dump and specialized debugging tools, the system programmer can determine where the components have failed.
* When the error has occurred in a software product, the system programmer works directly with the software vendor's support representatives to discover whether the problem's cause is known and whether a patch is available.
### Extras
* System programmers are needed to install and maintain the middleware on the mainframe, such as database management systems, online transaction processing systems and Web servers.
* Middleware is a software "layer" between the operating system and the end user or end user application.
* It supplies major functions that are not provided by the operating system.
* Major middleware products such as DB2®, CICS®, and IMS™ can be as complex as the operating system itself, if not more so.
